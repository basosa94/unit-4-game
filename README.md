# unit-4-game

### DESCRIPTION

This assignment utilizes jQuery to create an interactive game. The interactive game is Crystal Collectors. The objective of the game is to guess the number on the screen, ranging from 19-120, by clicking on four different crystals on the screen that are assigned random hidden values ranging from 1-12.

* The player wins a round when their total score matches the random number generated at the beginning of the game.

* The player loses a round if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. Scores are tallied each round, another random number is generated, and the counter is set back to 0.
